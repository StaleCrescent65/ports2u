# Hello World, I created this basic portscanner for any and all to use,
# The syntax is as follows

python ports2u.py -ip 192.168.1.0 -p 80

# The same thing can be done with multiple ports.

python ports2u.py -ip 192.168.1.0 -p 443,22,53

# And that's it. You can install this to your PATH Variable in order to get access to it
# from any directory by running the install_to_path.py file (:
