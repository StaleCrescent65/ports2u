# ports2u is a portscanner I made in python, check the following for syntax (:

python ports2u.py -ip 192.168.1.0 -p 80

- The same thing can be done with multiple ports.

python ports2u.py -ip 192.168.1.0 -p 443,22,53

NOTE: You can run install_to_path.py to install the scanner to your PATH variable, in other words, run ports2u.py from any directory.
